  abstract = {This study carries out a systematic /intrinsic/ evaluation of the semantic representations
	learned by state-of-the-art pre-trained multimodal Transformers.
	These representations are claimed to be task-agnostic and shown to help on many downstream language-and-vision tasks.
	However, the extent to which they align with human semantic intuitions remains unclear.
	We experiment with various models and obtain /static/ word representations from the /contextualized/ ones they learn.
	We then evaluate them against the semantic judgements provided by human speakers. In line with previous evidence,
	we observe a generalized advantage of multimodal representations over language-only ones on concrete word pairs,
  but not on abstract ones. On the one hand, this confirms the effectiveness of these models to
	align language and vision, which results in better semantic representations for concepts that are /grounded/ in images.
	On the other hand, models are shown to follow different representation learning patterns, which
	sheds some light on /how/ and /when/ they perform multimodal integration.}

    We find that speakers transmit information at a stable rate---i.e., rationally---in English newspaper articles

    We also observe that speakers' choices are not oriented towards local uniformity of information,

Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production.

To further illustrate the novel features of the dataset, we propose a baseline model for reference resolution which uses a simple method to take into account shared information accumulated in a reference chain.

In contrast with the standard computational approach that simplistically treats gradable adjectives as {`}fixed{'} attributes, we pose the problem as relational: to be successful, a model has to consider the full visual context. By means of four main tasks, we show that state-of-the-art models (but not a relatively strong baseline) can learn the function subtending the meaning of size adjectives, though their performance is found to decrease while moving from simple to more complex tasks.

  abstract = {We investigate the relation between negated adjectives and antonyms pairs in English (e.g., not cold vs. hot - cold) using Distributional Semantics. We build vector representations of a set of antonyms and their negations on the basis of their contexts of use, and compare the similarities of the negated adjectives to each of the adjective in their antonym pair. We find that in a distributional semantic model a negated adjective (e.g., not cold) is typically more similar to the adjective itself (cold) than to its antonym (hot). The effect is less strong for antonyms that share their lexical root (morphological; e.g., happy - unhappy). No difference is observed between simple and double negations (e.g., not happy, not unhappy), and contrary and contradictory antonyms (e.g., hot - cold, dead - alive). Our results provides insights on negated adjectives, and in general the type of similarity captured by Distributional Semantics.}

In particular, the Hub is implemented as a neural network encoder. We investigate the effect on this encoder of various vision-and-language tasks proposed in the literature: visual question answering, visual reference resolution, and visually grounded dialogue. To measure the quality of the representations learned by the encoder, we use two kinds of analyses. First, we evaluate the encoder pre-trained on the different vision-and-language tasks on an existing {``}diagnostic task{''} designed to assess multimodal semantic understanding. Second, we carry out a battery of analyses aimed at studying how the encoder merges and exploits the two modalities.",

The latter have been used to set visual dialogue games which are an interesting test bed to evaluate conversational agents. Researchers’ attention is on building models of increasing complexity, trained with computationally costly machine learning paradigms that lead to higher task success scores. In this paper, we take a step back: We use a rather simple neural network architecture and we scrutinize the GuessWhich task, the dataset, and the quality of the generated dialogues. We show that our simple Questioner agent reaches state-of-the art performance, that the evaluation metric commonly used is too coarse to compare different models, and that high task success does not correspond to high quality of the dialogues. Our work shows the importance of running detailed analyses of the results to spot possible models’ weaknesses rather than aiming to outperform state-of-the-art scores."

Using visualisations and diagnostic classifiers, we analyse the representations that are incrementally built by the model, and discover that models develop little to no awareness of the structure of disfluencies.

LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text."}

  abstract = "Although disfluent speech is pervasive in spoken conversation, disfluencies have received little attention within formal theories of grammar. The majority of work on disfluent language has come from psycholinguistic models of speech production and comprehension and from structural approaches designed to improve performance in speech applications. In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of this phenomenon in the scope of formal grammar, and present a detailed formal account which: (a) unifies disfluencies (self-repair) with Clarification Requests, without conflating them, (b) offers a precise explication of the roles of all key components of a disfluency, including editing phrases and filled pauses, and (c) accounts for the possibility of self addressed questions in a disfluency."
