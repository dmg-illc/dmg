  abstract = "We investigate the extent to which modern, neural language models are susceptible to structural priming, 
  the phenomenon whereby the structure of a sentence makes the same structure more probable in a follow-up  sentence. 
  We explore how priming can be used to study the potential of these models to learn abstract structural information, 
  which is a prerequisite for good performance on tasks that require natural language understanding skills. We introduce 
  a novel metric and release PRIME-LM, a large corpus where we control for various linguistic factors which interact with priming strength. 
  We find that Transformer models indeed show evidence of structural priming, but also that the generalisations they learned are to 
  some extent modulated by semantic information. Our experiments also show that the representations acquired by the models 
  may not only encode abstract sequential structure but involve certain level of hierarchical syntactic information. 
  More generally, our study shows that the priming paradigm is a useful, additional tool for gaining insights into the capacities 
  of language models and opens the door to future priming-based investigations that probe the model's internal states."

    in ensembles to assess their complementarity. Our results show that ensembling grammatical 
    profiles with XLM-R improves semantic change detection performance for most datasets and languages. 
    This indicates that language models do not fully cover the fine-grained morphological and syntactic 
    signals that are explicitly represented in grammatical profiles. An interesting exception are the 
    test sets where the time spans under analysis are much longer than the time gap between them 
    (for example, century-long spans with a one-year gap between them). Morphosyntactic change is 
    slow so grammatical profiles do not detect in such cases. In contrast, language models, thanks

    linguistic properties of human dialogues is of crucial importance for developing AI- based conversational

    what extent, current text-based NLP models can detect such linguistic differences, and what the features
    driving their predictions are. We show that models achieve a fairly good performance on age- group prediction,
    though the task appears to be more challenging compared to discourse. Through in-depth analysis of the
    best models’ errors and the most predictive cues, we show that, in dialogue, differences among age groups
    mostly concern stylistic and lexical choices. We believe these findings can inform future work on developing
    controlled generation models for adaptive conversational systems."

Taking inspiration from seminal work on dialogue analysis, we propose a data-collection task formulated as a collaborative game prompting two online participants to refer to images utilising both their visual context as well as previously established referring expressions. We provide a detailed description of the task setup and a thorough analysis of the 2,500 dialogues collected. To further illustrate the novel features of the dataset, we propose a baseline model for reference resolution which uses a simple method to take into account shared information accumulated in a reference chain. Our results show that this information is particularly important to resolve later descriptions and underline the need to develop more sophisticated models of common ground in dialogue interaction.",

Our visually-grounded encoder leverages synergies between guessing and asking questions, as it is trained jointly using multi-task learning. We further enrich our model via a cooperative learning regime. We show that the introduction of both the joint architecture and cooperative learning lead to accuracy improvements over the baseline system. We compare our approach to an alternative system which extends the baseline with reinforcement learning. Our in-depth analysis shows that the linguistic skills of the two models differ dramatically, despite approaching comparable performance levels. This points at the importance of analyzing the linguistic output of competing systems beyond numeric comparison solely based on task success.",

We present a model based on Graph Attention Networks that captures this observation. It dynamically explores the social graph of a user, computes a user representation given the most relevant connections for a target task, and combines it with linguistic information to make a prediction. We apply our model to three different tasks, evaluate it against alternative models, and analyse the results extensively, showing that it significantly outperforms other current methods.",

In contrast with the standard computational approach that simplistically treats gradable adjectives as {`}fixed{'} attributes, we pose the problem as relational: to be successful, a model has to consider the full visual context. By means of four main tasks, we show that state-of-the-art models (but not a relatively strong baseline) can learn the function subtending the meaning of size adjectives, though their performance is found to decrease while moving from simple to more complex tasks. Crucially, models fail in developing abstract representations of gradable adjectives that can be used compositionally.",

In previous work, models have been shown to fail in generalizing to unseen adjective-noun combinations. Here, we investigate whether, and to what extent, seeing some of these cases during training helps a model understand the rule subtending the task, i.e., that being big implies being not small, and vice versa.

We find that in a distributional semantic model a negated adjective (e.g., not cold) is typically more similar to the adjective itself (cold) than to its antonym (hot). The effect is less strong for antonyms that share their lexical root (morphological; e.g., happy - unhappy). No difference is observed between simple and double negations (e.g., not happy, not unhappy), and contrary and contradictory antonyms (e.g., hot - cold, dead - alive). Our results provides insights on negated adjectives, and in general the type of similarity captured by Distributional Semantics.}

We investigate the effect on this encoder of various vision-and-language tasks proposed in the literature: visual question answering, visual reference resolution, and visually grounded dialogue.

The latter have been used to set visual dialogue games which are an interesting test bed to evaluate conversational agents. Researchers’ attention is on building models of increasing complexity, trained with computationally costly machine learning paradigms that lead to higher task success scores. In this paper, we take a step back: We use a rather simple neural network architecture and we scrutinize the GuessWhich task, the dataset, and the quality of the generated dialogues. We show that our simple Questioner agent reaches state-of-the art performance, that the evaluation metric commonly used is too coarse to compare different models, and that high task success does not correspond to high quality of the dialogues. Our work shows the importance of running detailed analyses of the results to spot possible models’ weaknesses rather than aiming to outperform state-of-the-art scores."

Using visualisations and diagnostic classifiers, we analyse the representations that are incrementally built by the model, and discover that models develop little to no awareness of the structure of disfluencies.

In line with previous literature, our quantitative analysis shows that lexical entrainment is the most reliable predictor of task success, among the ones we compute. But also that there is a complex relationship between these factors – for example, neither high nor low, but rather intermediate levels of lexical alignment predict high perceived and factual success."

We conduct a corpus study on the use of parental corrective feedback and show that its presence in child directed speech is associated with a reduction of child subject omission errors in English."

LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text."}

The corpus includes several sub-corpora that correspond to different dialogue situations where parameters related to interactivity, visual access, and verbal channel have been manipulated in systematic ways. The corpus thus lends itself to very targeted studies of reference in spontaneous dialogue.",

The majority of work on disfluent language has come from psycholinguistic models of speech production and comprehension and from structural approaches designed to improve performance in speech applications. In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of this phenomenon in the scope of formal grammar, and present a detailed formal account which: (a) unifies disfluencies (self-repair) with Clarification Requests, without conflating them, (b) offers a precise explication of the roles of all key components of a disfluency, including editing phrases and filled pauses, and (c) accounts for the possibility of self addressed questions in a disfluency."
