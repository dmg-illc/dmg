abstract={This study presents a new model of processing difficulty rooted in resource allocation theory, Incremental Alternative Sampling (IAS). Differential difficulty for a linguistic unit is estimated with respect to a set of plausible alter-natives.  Compared to a surprisal-based model, it prescribes a more efficient use of a comprehender’s predicted continuations of partial linguistic stimuli thanks to (i) an expressive representation function that captures different lev-els of linguistic processing and (ii) the bootstrapping of long-horizon prediction error.  Our results show that IAS estimates of processing difficulty, computed with autoregressive language models via Monte Carlo estimation, have greater  predictive  power  than  surprisal  extracted  from  the  same  language models for most neural and behavioural responses under analysis---including reading times, event-related brain potentials, cloze and predictability judgements.   Perhaps  more  importantly,  IAS  estimates  provide  insight  into  the nature  of  the  predictive  mechanisms  that  generate  those  responses  during language comprehension.  Variability in neural and behavioural responses is well  explained  by  different  combinations  of  the  representational  and  temporal  resolution  of  prediction.   Processing  difficulty  calculated  at  varying representational domains reflects known relations to lexical, constructional, and structural levels of linguistic processing, and forecast horizons are deter-mined by a combination of experimental task setup and naturalness of the stimulus.   Beyond  enriching  psycholinguistic  models,  IAS  can  also  provide insights into the information processing mechanisms of computational language models.  Our analysis of next-word surprisal under the lenses of IAS reveals that,  despite the metric’s seemingly narrow focus on the upcoming word, language model surprisal implicitly captures anticipatory processing of multiple future lexical items.

abstract={There is an increasing trend towards evaluating NLP models with LLM-generated judgments instead of human judgments. In the absence of a comparison against human data, this raises concerns about the validity of these evaluations; in case they are conducted with proprietary models, this also raises concerns over reproducibility. We provide JUDGE-BENCH, a collection of 20 NLP datasets with human annotations, and comprehensively evaluate 11 current LLMs, covering both open-weight and proprietary models, for their ability to replicate the annotations. Our evaluations show that each LLM exhibits a large variance across datasets in its correlation to human judgments. We conclude that LLMs are not yet ready to systematically replace human judges in NLP.

      abstract={Gestures are inherent to human interaction and often complement speech in face-to-face communication, forming a multimodal communication system. An important task in gesture analysis is detecting a gesture's beginning and end. Research on automatic gesture detection has primarily focused on visual and kinematic information to detect a limited set of isolated or silent gestures with low variability, neglecting the integration of speech and vision signals to detect gestures that co-occur with speech. This work addresses this gap by focusing on co-speech gesture detection, emphasising the synchrony between speech and co-speech hand gestures. We address three main challenges: the variability of gesture forms, the temporal misalignment between gesture and speech onsets, and differences in sampling rate between modalities. We investigate extended speech time windows and employ separate backbone models for each modality to address the temporal misalignment and sampling rate differences. We utilize Transformer encoders in cross-modal and early fusion techniques to effectively align and integrate speech and skeletal sequences. The study results show that combining visual and speech information significantly enhances gesture detection performance. Our findings indicate that expanding the speech buffer beyond visual time segments improves performance and that multimodal integration using cross-modal and early fusion techniques outperforms baseline methods using unimodal and late fusion methods. Additionally, we find a correlation between the models' gesture prediction confidence and low-level speech frequency features potentially associated with gestures. Overall, the study provides a better understanding and detection methods for co-speech gestures, facilitating the analysis of multimodal communication.}

  abstract={In face-to-face dialogues, the form-meaning relationship of co-speech gestures varies depending on contextual factors such as what the gestures refer to and the individual characteristics of speakers. These factors make co-speech gesture representation learning challenging. How can we learn meaningful gestures representations considering gestures' variability and relationship with speech? This paper tackles this challenge by employing self-supervised contrastive learning techniques to learn gesture representations from skeletal and speech information. We propose an approach that includes both unimodal and multimodal pre-training to ground gesture representations in co-occurring speech. For training, we utilize a face-to-face dialogue dataset rich with representational iconic gestures. We conduct thorough intrinsic evaluations of the learned representations through comparison with human-annotated pairwise gesture similarity. Moreover, we perform a diagnostic probing analysis to assess the possibility of recovering interpretable gesture features from the learned representations. Our results show a significant positive correlation with human-annotated gesture similarity and reveal that the similarity between the learned representations is consistent with well-motivated patterns related to the dynamics of dialogue interaction. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that several features concerning the form of gestures can be recovered from the latent representations. Overall, this study shows that multimodal contrastive learning is a promising approach for learning gesture representations, which opens the door to using such representations in larger-scale gesture analysis studies.}

abstract={Generative large language models (LLMs) have been shown to exhibit harmful biases and stereotypes. While safety fine-tuning typically takes place in English, if at all, these models are being used by speakers of many different languages. There is existing evidence that the performance of these models is inconsistent across languages and that they discriminate based on demographic factors of the user. Motivated by this, we investigate whether the social stereotypes exhibited by LLMs differ as a function of the language used to prompt them, while controlling for cultural differences and task accuracy. To this end, we present MBBQ (Multilingual Bias Benchmark for Question-answering), a carefully curated version of the English BBQ dataset extended to Dutch, Spanish, and Turkish, which measures stereotypes
commonly held across these languages. We further complement MBBQ with a parallel control dataset to measure task performance on the question-answering task independently of bias. Our results based on several open-source and proprietary LLMs confirm that some non-English languages suffer from bias more than English, even when controlling for cultural shifts. Moreover, we observe significant cross-lingual differences in bias behaviour for all except the most accurate models. With the release of MBBQ, we hope to encourage further research on bias in multilingual settings. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Veranep/MBBQ.

Previous research on automatic ad understanding has reported impressive zero-shot accuracy of contrastive vision-and-language models (VLMs) on an ad-explanation retrieval task. Here, we examine the original task setup and show that contrastive VLMs can solve it by exploiting grounding heuristics. To control for this confound, we introduce TRADE, a new evaluation test set with adversarial grounded explanations. While these explanations look implausible to humans, we show that they "fool" four different contrastive VLMs. Our findings highlight the need for an improved operationalisation of automatic ad understanding that truly evaluates VLMs' multimodal reasoning abilities.}

abstract={While human speakers use a variety of different expressions when describing the same object in an image, giving rise to a distribution of plausible labels driven by pragmatic constraints, the extent to which current Vision and Language Large Language Models (VLLMs) can mimic this crucial feature of language use is an open question. This applies to common, everyday objects, but it is particularly interesting for uncommon or novel objects for which a category label may be lacking or fuzzy. Furthermore, humans show clear production preferences for highly context-sensitive expressions, such as the quantifiers `few' or `most'. In our work, we evaluate VLLMs (FROMAGe, BLIP-2, LLaVA) on three categories (nouns, attributes, and quantifiers) where humans show great subjective variability concerning the distribution over plausible labels, using datasets and resources mostly under-explored in previous work. Our results reveal mixed evidence on the ability of VLLMs to capture human naming preferences, with all models failing in tasks that require high-level reasoning such as assigning quantifiers.}

Part of this coordination effort surfaces as the reuse of linguistic behaviour across speakers, a process often referred to as alignment. While the presence of linguistic alignment is well documented in the literature, several questions remain open, including the extent to which patterns of reuse across speakers have an impact on the emergence of labelling conventions for novel referents. In this study, we put forward a methodology for automatically detecting shared lemmatised constructions—expressions with a common lexical core used by both speakers within a dialogue—and apply it to a referential communication corpus where participants aim to identify novel objects for which no established labels exist. Our analyses uncover the usage patterns of shared constructions in interaction and reveal that features such as their frequency and the amount of different constructions used for a referent are associated with the degree of object labelling convergence the participants exhibit after social interaction. More generally, the present study shows that automatically detected shared constructions offer a useful level of analysis to investigate the dynamics of reference negotiation in dialogue.}

Here, we explore the use of alignment in speech (words) and co-speech gestures (iconic gestures) in a referential communication task aimed at finding labels for novel objects in interaction. In particular, we investigate how people flexibly use lexical and gestural alignment to create shared labels for novel objects and whether alignment in speech and gesture are related over time. The present study shows that interlocutors not only establish shared labels multimodally but also keep aligning in words and iconic gestures over the interaction. We also show that the amount of lexical alignment positively correlates with the amount of gestural alignment over time, suggesting a close relationship between alignment in the vocal and manual modalities.}

 abstract = "The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly improved performance across various Natural Language Processing tasks. However, the performance of LLMs has been shown to deteriorate over time, indicating a lack of temporal generalization. To date, performance deterioration of LLMs is primarily attributed to the factual changes in the real world over time. However, not only the facts of the world, but also the language we use to describe it constantly changes. Recent studies have indicated a relationship between performance deterioration and semantic change. This is typically measured using perplexity scores and relative performance on downstream tasks. Yet, perplexity and accuracy do not explain the effects of temporally shifted data on LLMs in practice. In this work, we propose to assess lexico-semantic temporal generalization of a language model by exploiting the task of contextualized word definition generation. This in-depth semantic assessment enables interpretable insights into the possible mistakes a model may perpetrate due to meaning shift, and can be used to complement more coarse-grained measures like perplexity scores. To assess how semantic change impacts performance, we design the task by differentiating between semantically stable, changing, and emerging target words, and experiment with T5-base, fine-tuned for contextualized definition generation. Our results indicate that (i) the model’s performance deteriorates for the task of contextualized word definition generation, (ii) the performance deteriorates more for semantically changing words compared to semantically stable words, (iii) the model exhibits significantly lower performance and potential bias for emerging words, and (iv) the performance does not correlate with cross-entropy or (pseudo)-perplexity scores. Overall, our results show that definition generation can be a promising task to assess a model’s capacity for temporal generalization with respect to semantic change."

We show that model uncertainty does not mirror human clarification-seeking behavior, which suggests that using human clarification questions as supervision for deciding when to ask may not be the most effective way to resolve model uncertainty. To address this issue, we propose an approach to generating clarification questions based on model uncertainty estimation, compare it to several alternatives, and show that it leads to significant improvements in terms of task success. Our findings highlight the importance of equipping dialogue systems with the ability to assess their own uncertainty and exploit in interaction."

Using a corpus of Dutch image descriptions with concurrently collected eye-tracking data, we explore the nature of the variation in visuo-linguistic signals, and find that they correlate with each other. Given this result, we hypothesize that variation stems partly from the properties of the images, and explore whether image representations encoded by pretrained vision encoders can capture such variation. Our results indicate that pretrained models do so to a weak-to-moderate degree, suggesting that the models lack biases about what makes a stimulus complex for humans and what leads to variations in human outputs.",

To address this, we introduce a novel framework that reframes the task as a multi-phase sequence labeling problem rather than binary classification. Our model processes sequences of skeletal movements over time windows, uses Transformer encoders to learn contextual embeddings, and leverages Conditional Random Fields to perform sequence labeling. We evaluate our proposal on a large dataset of diverse co-speech gestures in task-oriented face- to-face dialogues. The results consistently demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms strong baseline mod- els in detecting gesture strokes. Furthermore, applying Transformer encoders to learn contextual embeddings from movement sequences substantially improves gesture unit detection. These results highlight our framework’s capacity to capture the fine-grained dynamics of co-speech gesture phases, paving the way for more nuanced and accurate gesture detection and analysis."

In this paper, we model a visually grounded referential game between a knowledgeable speaker and a listener with more limited visual and linguistic experience. Inspired by psycholinguistic theories, we endow our speaker with the ability to adapt its referring expressions via a simulation module that monitors the effectiveness of planned utterances from the listener{'}s perspective. We propose an adaptation mechanism building on plug-and-play approaches to controlled language generation, where utterance generation is steered on the fly by the simulator without finetuning the speaker{'}s underlying language model. Our results and analyses show that our approach is effective: the speaker{'}s utterances become closer to the listener{'}s domain of expertise, which leads to higher communicative success.",

abstract = {Abstract When communicating, people adapt their linguistic representations to those of their interlocutors. Previous studies have shown that this also occurs at the semantic level for vague and context-dependent terms such as quantifiers and uncertainty expressions. However, work to date has mostly focused on passive exposure to a given speaker's interpretation, without considering the possible role of active linguistic interaction. In this study, we focus on gradable adjectives big and small and develop a novel experimental paradigm that allows participants to ask clarification questions to figure out their interlocutor's interpretation. We find that, when in doubt, speakers do resort to this strategy, despite its inherent cognitive cost, and that doing so results in higher semantic alignment measured in terms of communicative success. While not all question–answer pairs are equally informative, we show that speakers become better questioners as the interaction progresses. Yet, the higher semantic alignment observed when speakers are able to ask questions does not increase over time. This suggests that conversational interaction's key advantage may be to boost coordination without committing to long-term semantic updates. Our findings shed new light on the mechanisms used by speakers to achieve semantic alignment and on how language is shaped by communication.},

We frame the task as a dialogue response generation, and test methods based on bag-of-words (BoW) and neural discriminators (Disc) to condition the output of GPT-2 and DialoGPT without altering the parameters of the language models. We show that Disc models achieve a higher degree of detectable control than BoW models based on automatic evaluation. In contrast, humans can partially detect age differences in BoW but not Disc responses. Since BoW responses are deemed better than Disc ones by humans, simple controllable methods thus appear to be a better tradeoff between adaptation and language quality. Our work confirms the challenges of adapting to higher-level dimensions of language variation. Moreover, it highlights the need to evaluate natural language generation thoroughly.",

This can happen at many levels of communication, including the tendency to code switch (CS), or change to another language. Alignment has often been considered the result of an unconscious automatic process that facilitates speakers' mutual understanding. In dialogues with a second language (L2) learner, alignment is constrained by the proficiency of the learner, and additional non-automatic processes will be at play, namely the individual pedagogical goals of learner and tutor. In this study, we investigate alignment in dialogues between Spanish/Catalan learners of English and their tutors. We analyse CS incidence, whether code switching can be explained as automatic alignment between speakers, and whether this is independent of other, non-automatic factors related to speakers’ goals. We find that alignment of code switching is present, varies with learner proficiency, and that code switching can additionally be triggered by lexical overlap and turn taking asymmetry, which we attribute to conscious pedagogical choices on the part of both tutor, at lower levels, and learner, at higher levels of student proficiency.}

We use distributional methods to quantify lexical semantic change and induce a social network on communities, based on interactions between members. We explore the relationship between semantic change and the clustering coefficient of a community{'}s social network graph, as well as community size and stability. While none of these factors are found to be significant on their own, we report a significant effect of their three-way interaction. We also report on significant word-level effects of frequency and change in frequency, which replicate previous findings.",

To further illustrate the novel features of the dataset, we propose a baseline model for reference resolution which uses a simple method to take into account shared information accumulated in a reference chain.

We further enrich our model via a cooperative learning regime. We show that the introduction of both the joint architecture and cooperative learning lead to accuracy improvements over the baseline system. We compare our approach to an alternative system which extends the baseline with reinforcement learning. Our in-depth analysis shows that the linguistic skills of the two models differ dramatically, despite approaching comparable performance levels. This points at the importance of analyzing the linguistic output of competing systems beyond numeric comparison solely based on task success.",

In contrast with the standard computational approach that simplistically treats gradable adjectives as {`}fixed{'} attributes, we pose the problem as relational: to be successful, a model has to consider the full visual context. By means of four main tasks, we show that state-of-the-art models (but not a relatively strong baseline) can learn the function subtending the meaning of size adjectives, though their performance is found to decrease while moving from simple to more complex tasks.

In this paper, we take a step back: We use a rather simple neural network architecture and we scrutinize the GuessWhich task, the dataset, and the quality of the generated dialogues. We show that our simple Questioner agent reaches state-of-the art performance, that the evaluation metric commonly used is too coarse to compare different models, and that high task success does not correspond to high quality of the dialogues.

We find that, contrary to earlier results, disfluencies have very little impact on the task success of seq-to-seq models with attention. Using visualisations and diagnostic classifiers, we analyse the representations that are incrementally built by the model, and discover that models develop little to no awareness of the structure of disfluencies. However, adding disfluencies to the data appears to help the model create clearer representations overall, as evidenced by the attention patterns the different models exhibit.",

Our analyses show that adding a decision making component produces dialogues that are less repetitive and that include fewer unnecessary questions, thus potentially leading to more efficient and less unnatural interactions.",

LAMBADA is a collection of narrative passages sharing the characteristic that human subjects are able to guess their last word if they are exposed to the whole passage, but not if they only see the last sentence preceding the target word. To succeed on LAMBADA, computational models cannot simply rely on local context, but must be able to keep track of information in the broader discourse. We show that LAMBADA exemplifies a wide range of linguistic phenomena, and that none of several state-of-the-art language models reaches accuracy above 1% on this novel benchmark. We thus propose LAMBADA as a challenging test set, meant to encourage the development of new models capable of genuine understanding of broad context in natural language text."}

The majority of work on disfluent language has come from psycholinguistic models of speech production and comprehension and from structural approaches designed to improve performance in speech applications. In this paper, we argue for the inclusion of this phenomenon in the scope of formal grammar, and present a detailed formal account which: (a) unifies disfluencies (self-repair) with Clarification Requests, without conflating them, (b) offers a precise explication of the roles of all key components of a disfluency, including editing phrases and filled pauses, and (c) accounts for the possibility of self addressed questions in a disfluency."
